# mldlsb
The Machine Learning | Deep Learning Second Brain

This is a repository to store knowledge that I gain through my career as a graduate student and software developer/data scientist. However, the accumulated information is somewhat general knowledge so that I want to make it publicly available. Note that this is a work in progress and does not at all claim correctness and completeness. Feel free to submit an issue if you have questions or correct me. Otherwise I am happy to receive a contribution with the fixed issue directly and of course if you want to share your knowledge too. I will try to add the reference to where ever it is possible, but some things are just memories for which I will have to trace the source at a later point in time. The topics will mostly be relevant to ML/DL but I can not guarantee that there will be some excursion into other topics as well. I will probably start versioning this repository for the sake of being open source, more on that in the contribution guideline.\
Without further to do, enjoy diving into this repository ðŸ˜‰

## Setup
In order to set everything up, I would recommend to create a virtual environment, like a `venv` or a `conda virtual environment`. From there you can pip install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
and then install the `mldlsb` package:
```
pip install .
```
or install it in editable mode if you want to avoide constant reinstallation when you update the repository:
```
pip install -e .
```
